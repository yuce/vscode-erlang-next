# Experimental Erlang/OTP Support for Visual Studio Code

This experimental extension provides Erlang/OTP support for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

A (Whatels)[https://github.com/yuce/whatels] server is required to be running for auto completion to work. See
[VSCode Erlang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuce.erlang-otp) for an extension without
the Whatels dependency (albeit without support for project modules/current module auto completion).

## Thanks

* Erlang syntax file is based on: https://github.com/pgourlain/vscode_erlang.
